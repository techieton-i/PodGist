## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## üéôÔ∏è Podcast Summarizer App

Overview

The Podcast Summarizer is a web-based application designed to generate AI-powered summaries of podcast episodes from a simple audio URL. It uses Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for fast, high-quality summarization and streams the generated content in real-time to the user interface.

- **Input**: Podcast episode audio URL
- **Output**: Real-time streamed summary
- **Stack**:

  - **Next.js (App Router)** + TypeScript
  - **Google GenAI SDK (Gemini)**
  - **MongoDB** for persistent caching
  - **Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI** for styling
  - **ReadableStream** APIs for streaming UX

---

### Thought Process & Architecture

#### Goals

- Minimal user friction (click to summarize)
- Real-time feedback via streaming
- Prevent duplicate LLM calls via DB cache
- Ensure mobile-first responsiveness

#### Architecture

```
Frontend (React)
  ‚¨á POST /api/summary
Backend API Route
  ‚¨á Connect to DB ‚Üí Check for existing summary
  ‚¨á If not found ‚Üí Fetch & encode audio
  ‚¨á Call Gemini ‚Üí Stream response
  ‚¨á Save full summary to MongoDB
  ‚¨Ö Stream summary back to client
```

#### Flow

1. User clicks **"Get Summary"**
2. Client sends `audioUrl` + `episodeId` to `/api/summary`
3. If summary exists in MongoDB ‚Üí return as JSON
4. If not ‚Üí audio is fetched, converted to base64, sent to Gemini
5. Gemini streams the summary ‚Üí streamed back to UI with typewriter effect
6. Final result is cached

### Challenges & Trade-offs

| Challenge                       | Solution / Trade-off                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Slow audio fetching             | Used `streamToBase64()` with streaming buffer handling            |
| Streaming delay in UI           | Character-by-character rendering + `TextDecoder` chunk management |
| Handling LLM timeouts           | `AbortController` + manual timeout setup (30s cap)                |
| Streaming cancel on modal close | Hooked into modal close event to abort fetch                      |
| Cross-device design             | Custom `useDeviceType()` hook to differentiate mobile/desktop     |

### Known Limitations

| Limitation                 | Notes                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Large audio files          | Streaming or converting huge MP3s can break memory/timeout limits |     |
| Gemini accuracy dependency | Output depends on model's interpretation of input                 |
| Only supports MP3 links    | No file uploads or WAV support yet                                |
| No multi-user history      | Summaries are stored per `episodeId` without user linkage         |
